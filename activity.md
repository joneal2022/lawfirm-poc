## Date: 2025-07-27

### Prompt: /plan so I have a requirements.md with all of the requirments for the project i want to develop. This is a POC!! Do not do any cloud infrastructure yet, I want to develop everything first and prove out the POC. There is also a file called design-notes.md that gives you tips on styling the ui, but was used for another project, use this template but update it with our project and requirements.md. There is also an activity.md file (used from another project) which is used as a template for you to log all of the prompts and changes you made, so we can pick up wherever we left off in another session. Again, overwrite both of the files design-notes.md and activity.md, they are just templates. But requirements.md is the full laid out requirements file for the project i want you to develop, creating a plan to start implementing that.
